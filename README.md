# Request Wheel

## Overview

Deployed at: http://requestwheel.com/

Managing church communications can be hard work.  There may be multiple publications to manage (newsletters, announcement videos, campus TV posters, etc.)  Many people may want their content in these distribution channels.  Request Wheel helps receive and organize those requests.  It's **way** better than coordinating publications solely through email or paper forms.  Contributors can see when (or if) their content will be published.
